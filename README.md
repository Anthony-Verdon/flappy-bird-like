# flappy-bird-like

How did I start Unity

## the Game

This game is a copy of the famous game flappy bird. Your goal is to dodge the pipe by jumping to score a maximum of points.

## How to install the game

For the moment, I don't know, sorry !

## How to play

To jump, you need to press space bar.

## What did I learn

This was my first ever game with Unity, so I learn many things :
- GameObjects (collisions, movements, etc ...)
- Multiples scenes
- Music
- User interface
- animation

## Possible upgrade

If you want, you can modify the game. There is some ideas :
- a button to adjust sound
- a file which save your best score if you quit the game
- another objective to win points (touch a target, a dangerous zone near the pipes, ...)
- ...
